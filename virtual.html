      The primary subject of virtual reality is simulating the vision. Every
      headset aims to perfect their approach to creating an immersive 3D
      environment. Each VR headset puts up a screen (or two – one for each eye)
      in front of eyes thus, eliminating any interaction with the real world.
      Two autofocus lenses are generally placed between the screen and the eyes
      that adjust based on individual eye movement and positioning. The visuals
      on the screen are rendered either by using a mobile phone or HDMI cable
      connected to a PC. To create a truly immersive virtual reality there are
      certain prerequisites – a frame rate of minimum 60fps, an equally
      competent refresh rate and minimum 100-degree field of view (FOV) (though
      180 degrees is ideal). The frame rate is the rate at which the GPU can
      process the images per second, screen refresh rate is the pace of the
      display to render images, and FOV is the extent to which the display can
      support eye and head movement. If either of these doesn’t work as per the
      standards the user can experience latency i.e. too much time gap between
      their actions and the response from the screen. We need the response to be
      less than 20 milliseconds to trick the brain which is achieved by
      combining all the above factors in the right proportion. Another issue
      that needs to be catered here is to prevent tearing (cybersickness)
      resulting due to the inconsistency between the frame rate and refresh
      rate. If the GPU’s fps is more than the screen refresh rate then the image
      can become distorted. To counter this issue, we limit the framerate to the
      monitor’s refresh rate this done using a tech called Vertical Sync
      (VSync). Among the major headsets available today, Vive and Rift both have
      110-degree FOVs, Google Cardboard has 90, the GearVR has 96 and the new
      Google Daydream offers up to 120 degrees. As for frame rate, both HTC Vive
      and Oculus Rift come with 90hz displays, while the PlayStation VR offers a
      60hz display.

      <span class="cls1">The Impact of Sound:</span>

      Sound effects, when synced with the visuals, can create very engaging
      effects. By using a headphone and 3D sound effects the user’s belief in
      the virtual environment can be reassured. While crafting sound effects due
      care needs to be taken about the consistency between the graphics and the
      sound. If you start playing horror music in the background of a fairy tale
      movie it will just put the user off.

      <span class="cls1">Eye and Head Tracking:</span>

      Eye and head tracking can be ensured using laser pointers, led lights or
      mobile sensors. In mobile, we use the accelerometer to detect
      three-dimensional movement, gyroscope for angular movement and
      magnetometer to identify the position relative to the Earth. If we need to
      achieve a very high accuracy then cameras and sensors can be installed in
      the room where you would use the headset. Although this is a much costlier
      setup as compared to using basic phone sensors. <br />
      <span class="cls-type">What can you expect in future?</span><br />In
      future, we will see rapid advancements in creating a truly immersive
      digital experience. With major players like Google, Microsoft, Oculus, and
      HTC making tremendous efforts to improve the current capabilities, we are
      not far from achieving a virtual reality that would feel so much better
      than the real world. The VR technology presents countless opportunities
      for brands to create breathtaking marketing content. Using this approach,
      they won’t only win over customers but also establish themselves as the
      leader in innovation. If would like to develop a VR app for your business
      then feel free to get in touch. With over 10 years of experience in mobile
      technologies, we can make every dream a reality. <br />
