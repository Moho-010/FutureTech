      Artificial Intelligence, or simply AI, is the term used to describe a
      machine's ability to simulate human intelligence. Actions like learning,
      logic, reasoning, perception, creativity, that were once considered unique
      to humans, is now being replicated by technology and used in every
      industry. <br />
      Artificial Intelligence is a complex field with many components and
      methodologies used to achieve the final result — an intelligent machine.
      AI was developed by studying the way the human brain thinks, learns and
      decides, then applying those biological mechanisms to computers. As
      opposed to classical computing, where coders provide the exact inputs,
      outputs, and logic, artificial intelligence is based on providing a
      machine the inputs and a desired outcome, letting the machine develop its
      own path to achieve its set goal. This frequently allows computers to
      better optimize a situation than humans, such as

      As you could imagine, artificial intelligence technology is evolving daily

      transportation and logistics, digital health, and multiple branches of
      fintech including insurtech and life insurance. <br />In the current
      scenario, COVID-19 doesn’t seem to have an end as this virus does not
      discriminate based on caste and creed. This pandemic situation has brought
      the world to a standstill and forced the plans of every individual to be
      rethought in a different dimension altogether concerning the new economic
      crisis that can be visualized by the experts. We have always observed how
      things get outmoded with time and in the case of technology, it is even at
      a rapid rate. Keeping this theory in mind everyone is afraid about the
      changes in technology that will take place post the pandemic bringing
      concern in various fields. The effect is going to be massive and
      long-lasting, but we need to learn a lot of things with the current
      situation and be ready for any kind of further circumstances impacting the
      lives and bringing it to a standstill. As human beings are learning,
      machines also need to be more advanced to understand these situations and
      react early and alert us for the upcoming catastrophes. Artificial
      Intelligence also termed as self-learning mechanism for the machines needs
      enormous advancement to make them future-ready. At present, the AI is
      evident in the areas of

      etc. <br />In the near term, the goal of keeping AI’s impact on society
      beneficial motivates research in many areas, from economics and law to
      technical topics such as verification, validity, security and control.
      Whereas it may be little more than a minor nuisance if your laptop crashes
      or gets hacked, it becomes all the more important that an AI system does
      what you want it to do if it controls your car, your airplane, your
      pacemaker, your automated trading system or your power grid. Another
      short-term challenge is preventing a devastating arms race in lethal
      autonomous weapons. In the long term, an important question is what will
      happen if the quest for strong AI succeeds and an AI system becomes better
      than humans at all cognitive tasks. As pointed out by I.J. Good in 1965,
      designing smarter AI systems is itself a cognitive task. Such a system
      could potentially undergo recursive self-improvement, triggering an
      intelligence explosion leaving human intellect far behind. By inventing
      revolutionary new technologies, such a superintelligence might help us
      eradicate war, disease, and poverty, and so the creation of strong AI
      might be the biggest event in human history. Some experts have expressed
      concern, though, that it might also be the last, unless we learn to align
      the goals of the AI with ours before it becomes superintelligent. There
      are some who question whether strong AI will ever be achieved, and others
      who insist that the creation of superintelligent AI is guaranteed to be
      beneficial. At FLI we recognize both of these possibilities, but also
      recognize the potential for an artificial intelligence system to
      intentionally or unintentionally cause great harm. We believe research
      today will help us better prepare for and prevent such potentially
      negative consequences in the future, thus enjoying the benefits of AI
      while avoiding pitfalls. <br />Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak,
      Bill Gates, and many other big names in science and technology have
      recently expressed concern in the media and via open letters about the
      risks posed by AI, joined by many leading AI researchers. Why is the
      subject suddenly in the headlines? The idea that the quest for strong AI
      would ultimately succeed was long thought of as science fiction, centuries
      or more away. However, thanks to recent breakthroughs, many AI milestones,
      which experts viewed as decades away merely five years ago, have now been
      reached, making many experts take seriously the possibility of
      superintelligence in our lifetime. While some experts still guess that
      human-level AI is centuries away, most AI researches at the 2015 Puerto
      Rico Conference guessed that it would happen before 2060. Since it may
      take decades to complete the required safety research, it is prudent to
      start it now. Because AI has the potential to become more intelligent than
      any human, we have no surefire way of predicting how it will behave. We
      can’t use past technological developments as much of a basis because we’ve
      never created anything that has the ability to, wittingly or unwittingly,
      outsmart us. The best example of what we could face may be our own
      evolution. People now control the planet, not because we’re the strongest,
      fastest or biggest, but because we’re the smartest. If we’re no longer the
      smartest, are we assured to remain in control? FLI’s position is that our
      civilization will flourish as long as we win the race between the growing
      power of technology and the wisdom with which we manage it. In the case of
      AI technology, FLI’s position is that the best way to win that race is not
      to impede the former, but to accelerate the latter, by supporting AI
      safety research. <br />
