      One of the most important benefits of building with green technology is the environmental impact. Green technology helps
      reduce emissions, conserves water, reduces waste, and consumes less energy than conventional technology. Green buildings
      also use materials more efficiently. The goal of green tech is to protect the environment, repair damage done to the ecological circumstance in the past,
      conserve natural resources and preserve the Earth's natural resources. Going green will make you less reliable on fuels
      and other harmful toxins. You will become self-sufficient and be able to create new and innovative ways to get back and
      forth to work while also saving energy in your homes and great benefits of green living are the benefits that come with
      green is a healthy lifestyle. These tech actions such as recycling, pollution reduction, nature conservation, and plant
      and tree cultivation will all create a much more sustainable world for us and our future generations.
      The main benefits of green computing are:
      reducing environmental impact (less GHG emissions, less e-waste, fewer virgin resources needed for manufacturing new
      devices),
      lower energy costs,
      long-lasting computing devices and
      reducing health risks for computer workers and recyclers. <br>

</span>
Plant science is key to addressing the major challenges facing humanity in the 21st Century,researchers argue that the development of new technology is key to transforming plant biology in order to meet human
needs. Plants serve as the conduit of energy into the biosphere, provide food and materials used by humans, and they shape our
environment. According to Ehrhardt and Frommer, the three major challenges facing humanity in our time are food, energy,
and environmental degradation. All three are plant related.

All of our food is produced by plants, either directly or indirectly via animals that eat them. Plants are a source of
energy production. And they are intimately involved in climate change and a major factor in a variety of environmental
concerns, including agricultural expansion and its impact on habitat destruction and waterway pollution.

Whatâ€™s more, none of these issues are independent of each other. Climate change places additional stresses on the food
supply and on various habitats. So plant research is instrumental in addressing all of these problems and moving into
the future.

      <p class="bio-tech"><h4 class="bio-title">Solar Power</h4>
      <span class="bio">The solar power industry is growing fast and is aiming at achieving enough solar capacity in the
        future. As one of the
        leading green technologies with implementation all over the world, a lot of innovations are coming up every day. From
        solar roof tiles and walls to large solar stations in deserts and smart solar innovations, car wash owners and
        other businesses can power their operations and cut energy costs.</span>

      <h4 class="bio-title">Biodegradable Products</h4>
      
      <span class="bio">Wind is one of most critical natural energies available, so it presents a key area of focus in green
        technology.
        Innovative wind turbines are now being created with more attractive designs, better durability in strong weather and
        better functionality even in low-wind environments.</span></p>
        <p class="bio-tech">
        <h4 class="bio-title">Vertical Farms</h4>
        
        
        <span class="bio">With global population rising fast, providing sufficient food for everyone will be a problem in the
          coming future,
          especially when arable farmland becomes progressively limited by productivity and space. The solution lies in vertical
          farms or indoor farming in densely populated cities.</span></p>
       <p class="bio-tech">
        <h4 class="bio-title">Living Buildings</h4>
      
      <span class="bio">Planting roof gardens on flat open top buildings has been going on for some time now. However, this
        technology is being
        pushed further by architects and designers with more innovative concepts of making entire buildings and cities green.
        Urban jungles also help absorb heat, rainwater, and carbon dioxide, as well as provide insulation.</span></p>

      <p class="bio-tech"><h4 class="bio-title">Green Computing</h4>
      
      <span class="bio">Environmentally sustainable computing is another example of future green technology. With over 60%
        system components
        ending up in landfills, the focus is now shifting to more efficient and effective designing, manufacturing, testing,
        using and disposing of computers and other related equipment and devices to ensure minimal or no impact on the
        environment. <br><br> The future of green technology is bright, with innovations expected to change the way we do things,
        use day-to-day items
        and even interact with our surroundings. </span></p>
