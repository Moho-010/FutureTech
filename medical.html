      Today, hospitals are where people go for diagnoses of their ills and for
      care. Physicians, with the aid of pricy machinery and medical techniques,
      provide consultations for patients. Likewise, people go for surgery and
      medical interventions such as chemotherapy in much the same manner, for
      monitoring and care. In the near future, however, advances in artificial
      intelligence (AI), information technologies, high-speed internet,
      remote-monitoring technology, and developments in 3D-printing and robotics
      will change all that. A revolution in diagnosis and care provision will
      take place. In the coming years, most of these tasks—and nearly all
      monitoring and care—could be moved elsewhere. The technological revolution
      and medical advances made by combining vast amounts of available data,
      cloud computing services, and machine learning are creating AI-based
      solutions to provide expert insight and analysis on a mass scale and at a
      relatively low cost. Major alterations have already been made in the way
      the healthcare industry works by connected medical devices. In the coming
      years, with the adaptation of technology-enabled care, the concept of the
      “Future Hospital” will become a reality. In this paper, advances in
      technology and medication, i.e. AI, 3D-printing, robotic surgery, and
      information technology (IT), in healthcare are noted. Following that,
      suggestions as to how these rapid advances in technology and medication
      may affect the architectural design of future healthcare facilities are
      presented. <br />

        Artificial Intelligence

      <br />Advances in AI have been made farther and faster than anyone could
      have anticipated. Today, AI can perform complicated activities such as
      image classification, speech recognition, translation, object detection,
      driving, gaming, finance, and even decision-making in law. Recently, a
      work of art was created by AI. Such activities require complex computing
      and decision making; previously they could only be performed by
      well-trained human beings. Much effort has been made recently by
      scientists and researchers to apply AI in diagnosis, treatment, and
      medical care. It seems that AI will soon change the landscape of
      healthcare completely. Medical physics predicts that AI will improve
      overall healthcare extensively. Some scientists believe that AI will
      impact medical physics research and practice, while others consider these
      expectations as unrealistic because of the technical validation and
      practical limitations of AI.1-3 AI is able to diagnose diseases by
      employing complex algorithms provided through the use of millions of
      patients’ imaging results, hundreds of biomarkers, data extracted from
      electronic health records (EHRs), and clinical research results published
      in PubMed.4Even though AI is still at the very first stages of
      development, it is as capable as (if not more capable than) physicians in
      diagnosing illness.5,6 According to Ibragimov,7 Wang, 8 and Xing,1 AI can
      be applied in radiology and radiation therapy for image classification,
      object detection, image reconstruction and analysis, image guidance, tumor
      detection and characterization, therapeutic response and toxicity
      prediction, treatment decision-making, and related tasks.

        Alzheimer’s and Coronary Heart Disease Detection

      <br />
      It is imaginable that precision diagnostics will be applied to severe and
      degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and coronary heart disease in
      addition to cancer. It is conceivably applicable for any disease related
      to genetics or imaging biomarkers. <br />

        Diagnosing Heart Disease
      </span>
      At John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, researchers developed a
      diagnostics system based on AI. Based on the reported results, this system
      is able to diagnosis heart disease 80% of the time; that is more accurate
      than a specialist’s results. A research team at Oxford University has
      published data and claim that they have developed the world’s most
      accurate echocardiography software which is able to diagnose coronary
      heart disease. Since the data is updated from a decade of imaging
      research, it is accurate 90% of the time.Researchers at the Firat
      University of Turkey have proposed a method of diagnosing heart disease
      based on neural networks ensembles. The method consists of applying SAS
      base software 9.1.3 for diagnosing with the neural networks. In this
      method, the predicted values (posterior probabilities) from multiple
      predecessor models were combined. The results of diagnosing heart disease
      were 80.95%.Researchers at the Department of Cardiopulmonary Sciences,
      University Hospital Santa Maria della Misericordia, Udine, Italy25
      developed a three-dimensional echocardiography by applying real-time
      three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) with software which measures left
      ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF). The results indicated
      that this proposed system was as accurate as the more time-consuming 4D
      TomTec software. <br />

        Nanotechnology
      </span>
      <br />
      With the aid of different smart devices, nanotechnology is developed in
      healthcare systems to monitor, diagnose, and treat patients. By applying
      those devices which rely on body-centric nanonetworks, sufficient
      information regarding the individual’s health is provided in real-time.
      Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology. Nanomedicine
      ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials and biological
      devices, to nanoelectronic biosensors, and even possible future
      applications of molecular nanotechnology such as biological machines.
      Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related
      to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials (materials
      whose structure is on the scale of nanometers, i.e. billionths of a
      meter). A ribosome is a biological machine. Functionalities can be added
      to nanomaterials by interfacing them with biological molecules or
      structures. The size of nanomaterials is similar to that of most
      biological molecules and structures; therefore, nanomaterials can be
      useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications.
      Thus far, the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the
      development of diagnostic devices, contrast agents, analytical tools,
      physical therapy applications, and drug delivery vehicles. Nanomedicine
      seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful
      devices in the near future. The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects
      new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may
      include advanced drug delivery systems, new therapies, and in vivo
      imaging. Nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the US National
      Institutes of Health Common Fund program, supporting four nanomedicine
      development centers. Nanomedicine sales reached $16 billion in 2015, with
      a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology R&D being invested every year.
      Global funding for emerging nanotechnology increased by 45% per year in
      recent years, with product sales exceeding $1 trillion in 2013. As the
      nanomedicine industry continues to grow, it is expected to have a
      significant impact on the economy.
