      In the past decade, progress continues in the development and deployment
      of autonomous driving technologies, as we see market leaders like Google's
      Waymo have achieved the milestones in on-road testing of their
      self-driving fleets, and companies like Tesla announced ambitious plans to
      commercialise robotaxi services in geo-fenced areas by 2020. Meanwhile, we
      have also seen GM delaying its plan to launch robotaxi services by the end
      of 2019 as it is not going to be able to validate the safety and
      performance in time. Autonomous driving is inevitable, but to achieve mass
      deployment of autonomous cars without onboard safety drivers on the public
      road is going to take time given the technology readiness, cost of
      autonomous driving systems as well as regulations. The autonomous driving
      industry players are taking two approaches: one being bottom-up from ADAS
      systems to a higher level of automation (mainly for the private car
      sector) and those skipping ADAS and directly developing Level 4+ systems
      (mainly for mobility services). Highly autonomous driving (Level 4+) will
      likely first be deployed in shared autonomous car services or robotaxis
      before penetrating into the private car sector. The reasons for that are
      bifold: the complexity of scenarios and the cost. For shared autonomous
      vehicles, the scenarios could be defined, which makes the deployment
      easier and faster in certain scenarios such as city zones. While for
      private-owned autonomous vehicles, it will be a much more complicated
      usage scenario that requires the vehicles to be able to drive themselves
      under rough road and weather conditions. In terms of cost, in the early
      stage, autonomous vehicles will still be too expensive for individual
      customers. However, for shared mobility service operators, the cost of
      autonomous vehicles can be swallowed by cutting the cost of a driver (over
      60% of the total cost), which makes them motivated to adopt autonomous
      driving technologies. According to IDTechEx's latest report titled
      "Autonomous Cars and Robotaxis 2020-2040", up to 10 percent of all new
      cars sold by 2030 would be Level 3+ autonomous. Among the highly
      autonomous cars (Level 4+) sold, over 75% will be for shared mobility
      services, and the private autonomous cars will remain niche (mostly for
      premium cars) until 2030. Level 4+ private-owned autonomous cars will
      increase rapidly after 2030 as costs come down and the market share will
      reach 42 percent by 2040, according to IDTechEx forecast. Autonomous
      driving systems are currently very expensive, but the cost is expected to
      decrease rapidly in the coming decade. Light image detection and ranging
      (lidar), the single most expensive component of an autonomous driving
      system, used to cost $75,000 per unit. But a new player, Luminar, recently
      announced lidar-based solutions for under $1,000. Other companies such as
      Tesla, adopt camera-based solutions which are currently much cheaper than
      a lidar one. Ultimately, an autonomous car will need multiple types of
      sensors, and from a commercial perspective, companies need to understand
      the optimal number of sensors required for safe autonomous driving.
      Besides sensors, autonomous driving requires a full technology stack of
      hardware and software components such as computing platforms, AI software
      and HD maps which are completely different from the traditional automotive
      approach. IDTechEx's new report offers an in-depth analysis of key
      enabling technologies including lidars, radars, cameras, AI software, HD
      maps, teleoperation, cybersecurity, and 5G & V2X. IDTechEx forecasts that
      autonomous car and mobitliy services will become a $2.5 trillion market by
      2040. For a more detailed analysis of the autonomous car and robotaxi
      market, please see IDTechEx's latest report on "Autonomous Cars and
      Robotaxis 2020-2040".

      <span class="cls">Are autonomous cars safe? </span> <br />
      With autonomous cars, there is no possibility of drunken driving,
      dizziness or the driver getting drowsy, which causes a lot of accidents.
      Removing the element of human error margin would undoubtedly lead to a
      marked decline in the number of accidents and make the roads safer and
      save many lives. Autonomous cars are much safer than human-driven cars.
      Theyâ€™re unaffected by factors like driver fatigue, emotion, or illness.
      This makes them very safe. Self-driving cars are always attentive and
      active, observing their environments and scanning multiple directions. It
      would be difficult to make a move that the car has not anticipated.
      Adoption of self-driving cars would mean safer roadways, which in turn
      would mean less demand for emergency response services, pricey insurance
      premiums, not to mention savings in accident-related health care for
      everyone. <br />The technological leaps and bounds we have made in recent
      years have finally culminated in making self-driving cars a reality.
      Self-driving cars are only possible today due to the existence of three
      technologies: <br /><span class="cls">IOT Sensor</span><br />
      There are many types of sensors available today that make autonomous cars
      a reality. Sensors for blind-spot monitoring, forward collision warning,
      radar, camera, LIDAR, and ultrasonic all work together to make navigation
      of a self-driving car possible.
      <br /><span class="cls">Software Algorithms</span><br />
      All the data the car collects needs to be analyzed to determine the best
      course of action. This is the main function of the control algorithms and
      software. This is the most complex part of the self-driving car since it
      has to make decisions flawlessly.<br /><span class="cls"
        >IOT Connectivity</span
      ><br />
      Self-driving cars use cloud computing to act upon traffic data, weather,
      maps, adjacent cars, and surface conditions among others. This helps them
      monitor their surroundings better and make informed decisions.
      Self-driving cars must be connected to the internet even if edge computing
      hardware can solve small computing tasks locally.
