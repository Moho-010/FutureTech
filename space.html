      Space technology is technology developed by space science or the aerospace
      industry for use in spaceflight, satellites, or space exploration. Space
      technology includes spacecraft, satellites, space stations, and support
      infrastructure, equipment, and procedures and space warfare. <br />
      <span class="cls">Will space travel ever be possible?</span><br />
      The truth is that interstellar travel and exploration is technically
      possible. There's no law of physics that outright forbids it. But that
      doesn't necessarily make it easy, and it certainly doesn't mean we'll
      achieve it in our lifetimes, let alone this century. Interstellar space
      travel is a real pain in the neck. <br />Space tourists will soon have
      another option at their disposal, if all goes according to plan. The new
      company Space Perspective aims to send paying customers and research
      payloads to the stratosphere aboard Spaceship Neptune, a balloon-borne
      pressurized capsule that's scheduled to make its first test flights early
      next year. "We’re committed to fundamentally changing the way people have
      access to space — both to perform much-needed research to benefit life on
      Earth and to affect how we view and connect with our planet," Space
      Perspective founder and co-CEO Jane Poynter said in a statement today
      (June 18), when the company announced its plans. "Today, it is more
      crucial than ever to see Earth as a planet, a spaceship for all humanity
      and our global biosphere," Poynter said, referencing the "overview effect"
      commonly cited by astronauts who have flown to space.

      The Spaceship Neptune capsule can accommodate a pilot and eight
      passengers, who will ride in style. The craft will feature seats, a bar, a
      bathroom and huge windows that will allow for great views of Earth against
      the blackness of space, company representatives said. The craft will
      launch from the old Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space
      Center (KSC) on Florida's Space Coast. Spaceship Neptune will head east
      out over the Atlantic Ocean on winter flights and west over the Gulf of
      Mexico during the summer, a seasonal shift dictated by the prevailing
      winds. Spaceship Neptune will spend about two hours getting up to a
      maximum altitude of about 100,000 feet (30,000 meters), pulled gently
      upward by a 650-foot-tall (200 m) balloon filled with buoyant hydrogen.
      "Helium has become quite difficult to obtain," Space Perspective founder
      and co-CEO Taber MacCallum said during a news conference today, explaining
      the choice of lift gas. "It's used for a lot of medical practices and for
      launching rockets." The capsule will spend about two hours high in the
      stratosphere, above 99% of Earth's atmosphere, then will spend another two
      hours coming back down again for a total flight time of six hours.
      Spaceship Neptune will be fished out of the sea by a recovery boat, much
      like SpaceX Crew Dragon capsules are today. The Spaceship Neptune capsule
      will be reused, but a new balloon will be needed for each mission. Space
      Perspective has not yet set a price for this balloon experience, but a
      ticket will likely sell for around $125,000 initially, MacCallum and
      Poynter said. That's about half the most recent stated price for a ride
      aboard Virgin Galactic's suborbital SpaceShipTwo space plane, which is
      expected to begin commercial operations soon. (Jeff Bezos' spaceflight
      company, Blue Origin, is also developing a suborbital space tourism
      vehicle, called New Shepard, which could get and running soon as well).<a
